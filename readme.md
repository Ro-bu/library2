# LIBRARY

:point_right: [Live Link](https://ro-bu.github.io/library2/)

Project from [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://theodinproject.com) to create a library app using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS, and a backend using Firebase.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/Ro-bu/library2.git
cd library2
npm install
npm start
```

## Objectives & Outcomes

The main goal for this project was to create a backend for the first time. I refactored an old project in order to focus fully on the backend. For simplicity and easier understanding the curriculum suggested using Firebase BaaS.

Beyond that, other learning outcomes were:

- How to manage users and logins
- How to structure and manage data
